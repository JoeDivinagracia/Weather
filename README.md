# Weather

A little project to help me learn C++ and also libcurl for making web requests in C++.

To get this working, you'll need to go to api.openweathermap.org and sign up for an API key. All of the functionality that is currently, and will be, implemented use the free modules provided by openweathermap.

All json parsing in this app is done by Niels Lohmann's json repo. https://github.com/nlohmann/json
